# OpenDoomUnity
OpenDoomUnity is a free and open-source community re-implementation of Doom within Unity.

## Play with OpenDoomUnity
OpenDoomUnity will require original files of Doom Run to play.

## Contribute to OpenDoomUnity
 - No assets relating to 'OpenDoomUnity' are to exist within this repo, 100% of this repo should only hold base Unity project files and script files relating to implementing features relating to the original game. Assets from the original game will be retrieved by pointing to the original files at runtime. Again, to run this you must have an original install of ‘OpenDoomUnity’ to use this software. Anyone at all can help with the project!
